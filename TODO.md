## Completed Work Summary
1. **MVVM Architecture**: ViewModels, Repository pattern, proper separation of concerns
2. **Dependency Injection**: Hilt integration with proper scoping and lifecycle management
3. **Room Database**: Message persistence with proper DAOs and entity mapping
4. **Coroutines & Flow**: Converted callbacks to coroutines, implemented Flow for reactive streams, proper scope management
5. **Connection Status**: Visual indicator with real-time updates, activity-based detection
6. **Sleep/Wake Handling**: Auto-recovery when messages resume after device sleep

## Development Notes
- Architecture foundation (Phase 1) should be completed before moving to advanced features
- UI/UX improvements (Phase 3) can be done in parallel with feature development
- Testing (Phase 7) should be implemented incrementally as features are added
- Security features (Phase 5) are important for production readiness
