## Current Status
- âœ… Phase 1.1 - MVVM Architecture - COMPLETED
- âœ… Phase 1.2 - Dependency Injection with Hilt - COMPLETED
- âœ… Phase 2.1 - Connection Status Management - COMPLETED
- ðŸš€ Next Priority Options:
  - Phase 1.3 - Room Database (Foundation for persistence)
  - Phase 2.2 - User List Feature (Core UX)
  - Phase 2.3 - Enhanced Messaging (Better UX)
  - Phase 3.1 - Material 3 Update (Modern UI)

## Completed Work Summary
1. **MVVM Architecture**: ViewModels, Repository pattern, proper separation of concerns
2. **Dependency Injection**: Hilt integration with proper scoping and lifecycle management
3. **Connection Status**: Visual indicator with real-time updates, activity-based detection
4. **Sleep/Wake Handling**: Auto-recovery when messages resume after device sleep

## Development Notes
- Architecture foundation (Phase 1) should be completed before moving to advanced features
- UI/UX improvements (Phase 3) can be done in parallel with feature development
- Testing (Phase 7) should be implemented incrementally as features are added
- Security features (Phase 5) are important for production readiness
